contribution:
- Banks run on Excel. I built and supported front office trading spreadsheets reporting and calculating daily profit and loss, using in-house Alib quant libraries all written in C++. I'd design and build the final dashboards that traders would use on their desks.
- Built a web dashboard to monitor the progress of a middle office process. This was an individual project where I built both backend and front end. SSIS, DTS packages running in the background with C# Asp.net front end to display results. This was way back when ajax was a bit of a new concept, so this was kind of innovative.
